title: What is this?

You are currently on the user-facing documentation. This only documents APIs, which are exposed to you, so you can implement Scramjet into your site without having to worry about the internals of the library.

[**Switch to developer-facing documentation**](/typedoc-dev) to see all APIs used internally too.
