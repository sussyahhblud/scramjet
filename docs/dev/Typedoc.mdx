title: What is this?
---

The current doc you are reading is generated with [typedoc-plugin-markdown](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/typedoc-plugin-markdown).

Typedoc documents all of the Scramjet APIs. Specifically, you are on the developer-facing documentation, so you will see APIs documented, which aren't exposed publicly in the package.

[**Switch to user-facing documentation**](/typedoc) to see what you actually need if you aren't a contributor, rather an implementor or someone interested in Scramjet.
