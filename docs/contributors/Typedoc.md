# Typedoc

Scramjet comes with a Typedoc.
There is information about how to run it locally in the [README](../README.md).
There are two types of Typedoc generated: user-facing (main) and developer-facing (dev).
The user-facing documentation is generated at `/typedoc`, and the developer-facing documentation is generated at `/typedoc/dev`.
The site is generated by the [CI here](../../.github/workflows/) under the job "pages". You can simulate that CI job with the script at `scripts/serve-static.sh`. This includes the demo and the Typedoc.

## How versioning works

Versioning is handled [this plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shipgirl/typedoc-plugin-versions).
[This CI script](../../ci/download-existing-docs.sh) downloads the previous Typedoc builds from the artifacts for all Scramjet releases with the latest from the package version.
